# GomokuAI
A simple ai for the Gomoku game (2017 - EPITECH)

## Gomoku
The Gomoku is a simple japanese game that play like tic-tac-toe, except that you need to align 5 pieces instead of just 3.

## The AI
The ai uses a cell value evaluation algorithm to determine the best move. I've implemented a monte-carlo based algorithm too but it was less performant than the cell value based version.
